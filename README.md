# COVID TRACKER
This is a studio project done as a part of my Programming Studio 1 course assignment in a group of 2. 

# Project Description
This website contains information to prevent the spread of COVID-19 as well as potential symptopms. It contains the total number of cases and deaths worldwide in the time period January 2020 to April 2021. The choropleth map helps visualise the data, which can also be read from the tables presented. This website allows you to  select a specific country and find the COVID infections or deaths in neighbouring countries within your specified radius.
